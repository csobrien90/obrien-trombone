# Chad O'Brien Web Site

*This website is my landing page as a freelance musician. It is a mobile-first, responsive design using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This site also serves as my final project for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development class; below are the CSS and JS features required for successful completion of the course.*

## CSS features

A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

Use Flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.

Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Treehouse track, you will have to research this on your own

## JavaScript features

Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. 

Create at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page

---

### These features are currently included in the site design. Below are items intended in the final product:

***CSS features***

Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table 

Perform a Web Accessibility Compliance review on your own site and document all the tools and testing you used to verify your site is accessible. This may involve a written write-up, screenshots, and other ways of showing that you evaluated your site for accessibility compliance. Include the report in your GitHub repository.


***JavaScript features***

Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.

Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page

Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page - for example displaying a number of list items based on how many times you loop
