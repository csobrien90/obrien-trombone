                        <h2>About Me</h1>
                        <p>My name is Chad O'Brien. Originally from the suburbs of Chicago, I now live in Louisville, Kentucky with my wife, 
                            Emily, and our many pets where I pursue my many and varied passions (see below). I love meeting new people and 
                            learning new things - and Louisville, in all its diverse beauty, is the perfect place for this. In the five 
                            years since Emily and I moved here we've built quite a life, exploring and sampling the excellent food, drink, 
                            music, and art scenes and making some great friends along the way. Having recently bought a house, we're 
                            planning on staying in town for the forseeable future; and I am so looking forward to the many adventures to 
                            come!</p>
