                        <p>I have no background in farming. Yet I eat produce from my garden almost every day (spring through fall) 
                            and eggs laid by my own chickens (we get about three dozen eggs per week). And I can now add another 
                            thing: the honey I use to sweeten my daily cup of coffee was stolen from my own bees. Before you think 
                            "how impressive!" I want to remind you - <em>I have no background in farming</em>. So how am I able to 
                            do all of this? The answer is very simple and I hope it inspires you to try something new. I just do it. 
                            Even though I may know basically nothing about it, I try it. Normally, the first attempt is not great 
                            (you DO NOT want to taste last year's corn salsa &#129326). But I keep doing it, getting slightly better each 
                            time by trying to learn from my past mistakes and letting my natural curiousity guide some light research 
                            along the way.</p><br>

                        <p>My first blog post!!! I may have started a blog when I was very young, in which case this wouldn't actually 
                        be my first blog, but I (thankfully) can't find such a thing online. So I'm staking my claim now! My intention 
                        is for this blog to be an outlet for me - an opportunity to let my consiousness stream out and into the ether. 
                        I often find myself yearning to write, to document a project I am working on, to brainstorm an issue I am 
                        grappling with, to express myself creatively through prose and poetry, etc.</p><br><p>Will anyone read this? I kind of 
                        hope not...I think it will be freeing for me to write with the preconception that no one will ever see and, at the same 
                        time, cathardic for me to accept that someone may read it and that is okay. Being a musician has given me all sorts 
                        of baggage about what I put out into the world - given me this problematic idea that everything I create to 
                        be in public view must be the perfect encapsulation of my skills and identity as a creator. What a foolish 
                        idea. I take an undue amount of pride being genuinely myself but cringe when I release something containing even 
                        the slightest imperfection. As with everything, it (I) will be a work in progress. Anyways, if you're reading this, 
                        you now have a pretty good idea for what you're in for. I hope you enjoy! Or maybe I don't care? Working on it...</p>
